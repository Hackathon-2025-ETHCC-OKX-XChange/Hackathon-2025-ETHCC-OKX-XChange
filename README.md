## üöÄ Vision

**What if you could fund NGOs without losing your capital?**

- Traditional donations mean your money is gone forever.
- **X-Change** flips the model ‚Äî you stake your crypto (ETH/USDC) on behalf of NGOs. The yield funds their work, while you reclaim your full principal after 6‚Äì24 months.

## üìñ Background

I‚Äôm a **DeFi builder**, **fintech founder**, and **social activist**.
While exploring DeFi innovations like **self-repaying loans** (e.g., Alchemix), I began to wonder:
**What if the same concept could fund NGOs sustainably ‚Äî without donors losing their capital?**

That question sparked the creation of **X-Change**.

## ‚ùó Problems We‚Äôre Solving

- **High Fundraising Commissions** ‚Äî In developing countries like Malaysia, NGOs often rely on fundraising agents who take **20%‚Äì70%** of the total raised.
- **Unsustainable Funding Model** ‚Äî NGOs typically receive funds as a one-time lump sum, which is difficult for long-term planning and sustainability.
- **Permanent Capital Loss** ‚Äî Traditional donations mean the donor‚Äôs money is gone forever, creating a psychological barrier to giving.

## üí° How It Works

1. **Choose an NGO** from our verified on-chain registry.
2. **Stake your tokens** (USDC or WETH) for a fixed term (6, 12, or 24 months).
3. **Set your yield allocation** ‚Äî 50%, 75%, or 100% to the NGO. The funds will be used to generate yield on platform like Aave or Pendle.
4. **Retrieve your full principal** at the end of the term (plus extra yield if partial allocation).

**Example:** Stake $1,000 USDC at 10% APY for 12 months, allocating 75% yield to the NGO.
- NGO receives $75
- You get back $1,000 principal + $25 yield

## üèó Architecture

### üîó On-Chain
- **Network:** X Layer Mainnet (Chain ID: 196) - because we can't get OKB tokens on Testnet üôà
- All contracts deployed & verified on OKLink
- **3 verified NGOs** ready for staking
- Mock tokens with simulated APY (USDC 10%, WETH 8%)

### üé® Frontend
- **Next.js 15** + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **RainbowKit** wallet integration
- Real-time price feeds from **OKX DEX API**
- Fully responsive & mobile-friendly UI
